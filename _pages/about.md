I am a final year PhD Researcher at the University of Southampton, UK, supervised by Professor [Phillip Warwick](https://www.southampton.ac.uk/people/5wyy9x/professor-phillip-warwick) and Professor [Matthew Mowlem](https://noc.ac.uk/n/Matthew+Mowlem) at the National Oceanography Centre. My research focusses on the development of novel microfluidic platforms for difficult to measure radionuclides. I received my B.Sc in Chemistry from the University of Southampton in 2017.
